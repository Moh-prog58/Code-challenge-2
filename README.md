# Event Guest List Manager 

This is a small web app I made to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It lets you:
- Add guest names using a form
- Display the names on the page
- Remove names from the list
- No page reloads! It's all done with JavaScript

## Why I made it

Iâ€™m still learning how to code, so this was a challenge to help me get more comfortable with:
- DOM manipulation
- Handling form inputs
- JavaScript functions
- Keeping my code organized# Code-challenge-2
